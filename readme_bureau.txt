Electric Height Adjustable Standing Desk Frame Dual Motor and Memory Control


This standing desk frame allows you to find that much needed healthy balance of sitting and standing throughout the long work day. Every 30 minutes, you sit for 20 minutes, stand for 8, and get up and move for 2. It will help ease you into a routine of standing more productive and vigorous.  
  

With our electric adjustable desk frame, you can attach your own desktop surface and use the electric memory handset to adjust the height from 27” to 48” tall. It has a lift mechanism driven by hidden-drive internal multi-motors for an adjustable desk frame only and requires a separate purchase of a tabletop with a recommended width of 47 1/4" to 70.9", width of 23.6" to 31.5", and a thickness of 3/4” and greater. The handset has 4 programmable memory settings, 1 preprogrammed home setting and up/down manual adjustment buttons. Ultra-quiet electric motor will not disturb other people and is protected from overheating and overloading. Power source is required. The frame expands from 44” to 60.5” long, but make sure to measure your own desktop surface to ensure a proper fit. Desktop surface is not included. Assembly is an easy-to-do process and we include all the necessary hardware to get your desk frame put together and mounted to your desired desktop. 

Being a simple solution to the adverse effects of being sedentary, this adjustable-height standing desk allows you to easily switch between sitting and standing throughout the day--boosting your mood, energy levels and concentration when you need it. Be more alert and efficient, naturally.
